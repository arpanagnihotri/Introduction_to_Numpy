# Introduction_to_Numpy
NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.
